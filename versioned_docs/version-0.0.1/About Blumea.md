Let's discover **Blumea in less than 5 minutes**.

Blumea is a simple and efficient Bloom filter implementation for your applications. It's designed to help you determine whether an element belongs to a set in a space-efficient way.

## 🔖 About Bloom Filters

A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that allows you to test if an element is in a set. It does so by using a bit array and multiple hash functions to check if a given element is likely to be in the set or not. This makes Bloom filters ideal for use cases where space is at a premium, or when you need to test for set membership quickly.

One common example of where Bloom filters are useful is in checking the availability of usernames. Here, the set is the list of all registered usernames, and Bloom filters can be used to determine if a new username is already taken. The downside of Bloom filters is that they are probabilistic in nature and can sometimes give false positives (indicating that an element is in the set when it isn't).
